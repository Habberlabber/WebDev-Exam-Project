*Additional information*

Use any library/framework you like
Remember to write a report as well.
The report is about your considerations... why you use bootstrap, why not plain grid
Why do you use a loop and not a foreach
Why selectors with JQUERY and not query.selector
Why 1 file vs several files to store data
How do you use localStorage, the purpose of it in your project
Why do you use AJAX and not just individual pages
Why the email is sent to the customer
How did you test the system
How do you test the APIs (Postman)
If you have a server, how do you upload to the server
Conclusion... what was good, what was bad, how, where, who, when... about anything that you cannot explain with code.
